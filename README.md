# Simple Twitter bot to automate image posting from a folder

A friend asked for help with this project and I modified the code to fit his requirements for him.
It is only public so they can acces it as needed... This is not a shining star project or anything if you are a recruiter...
README.md

1. Update the keys in config.js
2. Put all your images into the `images` folder.
3. If you want to delete the image after posting, see the commented code in server.js

After your keys have been added just run it with...
node ./server.js
